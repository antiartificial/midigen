## MIDI Generator App - Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get your MIDI Generator app up and running:

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```
   cd /Users/arti/Desktop/Claude/midigen
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This will install React, Tone.js, and other required packages defined in package.json.

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the app in development mode and should automatically open a browser window to http://localhost:3000.

4. If the browser doesn't open automatically, navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Notes on Functionality:

- The app allows you to generate melodies in different styles (80s Synthwave/Disco and Metal)
- You can select which melodies to play using the checkboxes
- Each melody has its own Play/Stop button for individual playback
- The "Download MIDI" feature creates a simplified MIDI representation (for a full implementation, you'd need to add a proper MIDI encoding library)
- The visualization shows a rough representation of the notes in each melody

## Possible Enhancements:

1. **Add a proper MIDI library**: Consider adding a library like `midi-writer-js` for full MIDI file generation:
   ```
   npm install midi-writer-js
   ```

2. **Add more musical styles**: The code structure makes it easy to add new style generators

3. **Add more advanced synthesis**: Tone.js supports more complex synthesizers and effects

4. **Save and load functionality**: Allow users to save their generated compositions

5. **Tempo and key controls**: Add ability to change the tempo and musical key

Enjoy creating music with your new MIDI Generator app!
